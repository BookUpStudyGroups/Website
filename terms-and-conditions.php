<p>A user must be 18 years of age or older to register and use the Website. To register, a user must be a legal resident of the United States and must be an individual, not a corporation or other business entity. Membership is void where otherwise prohibited by law. Your use of BookUp.org must be in accordance and in a manner consistent with all applicable state and federal laws.
